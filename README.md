## Import, generate and automatically solve mazes

Just a pet project inspired by a "ComputerPhile" episode.

## Import

The software can import clean images of mazes

## Generate

Mazes can be generated using a few different algorithms, yielding different difficulties and esthetics. The available options are:

- Recursive Backtracking
- Randomized Kruskal's algorithm
- Randomized Prim's algorithm
- Recursive Division method

## Solve

All imported and generated mazes can be solved or shown as unsolvable. Currently the only available option for solving is the A-star pathfinding algorithm.
